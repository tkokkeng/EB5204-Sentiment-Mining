My hotel (the Swissotel) was connected to the Raffles City mall, so that made it very convenient, but I still would have made the effort to go back. \\n\\nThere was usually a line but it cleared quickly and the hostesses provided order sheets and menus so you could decide on your meal before you sat down. One of my favorite parts of the experience was the \"crib\" they provide for ladies\\' bags and that once you put your bag inside they cover it with a napkin as if the bags are being tucked in for a nap. \\n\\nBut my most favorite thing were the dumplings. These soup dumplings might be the most delightful thing I have ever eaten. The sensation of putting one in your mouth and the warm soup bursting out (yeah, yeah, *phrasing boom*) just brings a smile to your face. The texture of the dumplings is firm, but soft, and the soup has great flavor. I tried several varieties, with the traditional pork being my favorite. The shrimp and the chicken were also good, but I didn\\'t care for the crab very much. I also tried the shrimp fried rice and an eggplant side dish and both were great. \\n\\nI\\'ve seriously been telling everyone about these dumplings since I went on this trip.

Definitely worth the wait.\",\n   'reviewRating': {'ratingValue': 5}},\n  {'author': 'Mark D.',\n   'datePublished': '2013-08-13',\n   'description': \"On a personal note, this is the last restaurant review I will write from my recent time living in Singapore.  I truly loved the island and took immense joy in exploring its varied culinary landscape.  It is special place populated by such amazing people (locals and expats).  From the depth of my heart, I hope I am able to return someday.\\n\\nThis is a review of dinner with two friends at Din Tai Fung in Raffles City Shopping Centre.\\n\\nhttp://tinyurl.com/lvn2cb4\\n\\nThis Din Tai Fung is located in the basement level of Raffles CIty.  It is pretty far into the level and can be a little difficult to locate.  Also, unless you arrive early for dinner, you should expect a wait.  I think we arrived around 6:30 or so.  We had a 20 to 25 minute wait for our table.  But, I think those arriving when we were being seated were probably having a little longer wait.\\n\\nThe ambiance is a notch above basic but still trends towards the functional.  I would not place it at the level of fine dining.  It lacks the attention to detail that a fine dining room displays.\\n\\nhttp://tinyurl.com/kldx5xd\\n\\nThe staff is very effective.  I wouldn't necessarily use the word friendly.  Though they are certainly not rude.  Everyone just seems too busy and focused on their tasks to take a moment for overt politeness.  Also, the experience seems to be based on speed; get folks seated, get their order, get them their food ASAP, and get them on their way, rinse and repeat.\\n\\nThe food ranged from good to extremely good.\\n\\nhttp://tinyurl.com/lfurlwm\\n\\nCrispy Prawn Pancake - This was my least favourite dish. There wasn't anything  particularly wrong with it but it lacked layers of flavours that would have brought it up a notch.\\n\\nhttp://tinyurl.com/md9rrdp\\n\\nChicken with wine sauce - This was such a enjoyable chicken dish.  it is another example of a dish that allowed the basic ingredient to shine through.  The wine sauce complimented the chicken without overwhelming it.  Plus, the chicken was very tender.\\n\\nhttp://tinyurl.com/lyzsb9g\\n\\nPrawn Fried Rice - I love rice.  But I tend to prefer steamed rices.  However, if I keep running into fried rices as good as this, I may become a convert.  It was light.  The prawns were sweet.  The eggs provided a rich earthy note.  At some level, it was difficult to believe this was a fried dish.\\n\\nhttp://tinyurl.com/kcpztlb\\n\\nCold Pork - I enjoyed the flavours of this dish.  The lightness of the pork.  The freshness of the onions.  The nice touch of the sesame seeds.  All that being said, I would prefer this dish with the pork served hot.\\n\\nhttp://tinyurl.com/mc6hn5j\\n\\nPrawn Dumplings - I love prawn dumplings.  These were very good.  Fresh, hot, sweet, etc..\\n\\nhttp://tinyurl.com/lpqr9n5\\n\\nXia Long Bao (soup dumplings) - This is the dish that brings a lot of folks to Din Tai Fung.   They did not disappoint.  Dipped into the vinegar and ginger and then popped into your mouth for a flavour explosion.  Just make sure not to burn yourself.\\n\\nhttp://tinyurl.com/m7efulr\\n\\nI do not know the cost.  My friends were kind enough to treat me to dinner.\\n\\nOverall - Din Tai Fung is about the food and they delivered.  For the overall experience, I would say this was more 3.5 star than 4.  The food definitely warranted 4 stars.  The service could be a little more personable and little less rushed.   But, I guess if they didn't hurry, we would all have to wait a little longer to get our delicious Xia Long Bao.\",\n   'reviewRating': {'ratingValue': 4}},\n  {'author': 'Diana Y.',\n   'datePublished': '2016-01-11',\n   'description': \"Din Tai Fung is a great place to take first-time visitors to Singapore, especially when you're on a moderate budget.

Naturally, once I found out that there was a location minutes away from my hotel in Singapore, I just had to check it out for comparison purposes. \\n\\nPrices are definitely higher, which is no shocking surprise. In the US, it's around $7-8 for a 10 pc of the juicy pork dumplings. In Singapore, it's closer to $11-12. The group of us weren't that hungry, so we only ordered 20 total for 4 people. Not only do they tack on $1 per person for tea (without even asking), but they also automatically added a service charge. So it ended up being close to $30 US dollars.\\n\\nNot a good value, by any means, and the XLB's where just about the same compared to the Arcadia location.

HAD to. We were in the area because there was a little anime festival going on at Funan mall, and this was the closest thing that served xiao long bao. \\n\\nWe were seated promptly, and politely. It was rather cramped- you can tell they're trying to maximize space, and when there's only 2 people in your party... well. But really, we're not big, so we didn't mind rubbing elbows a little. Wound up chatting a bit to a couple of Frenchmen that were dining next to us, actually! (Frenchmen! You never get Frenchmen in Phoenix. I sometimes forget how urbane Singapore is.) \\n\\nThe food we ordered was pretty standard. I waffled about getting the truffle xiao long bao but decided against it, going instead for the regular order of that, plus the signature jiao zi. My girlfriend got the dan dan mien, I got the zha jiang mien. We also shared the pickled shredded vegetables. \\n\\nEverything was pretty good- the skin on the bao thin, the broth hot. My zha jiang mien was delicious, and definitely better than what I could replicate at home. Mostly it was just a good fix of chinese food, and the coveted xiao long bao. I don't get a chance to have food like this back in Phoenix. \\n\\n3.5 stars out of 5 for sure. Didn't round up as #1- it's a chain restaurant and #2, really nothing out of this world.
